# TLS-Leveling

## A set of tools to automate the leveling in The Last Sunrise.

This package will allow your character to step through an area one room at a time and kill monsters.

## Installation

You can use the following command in Mudlet to install the latest version:

`lua installPackage("https://github.com/Albonation/TLS-Leveling/releases/latest/download/TLS-Leveling.mpackage")`

Once you have it installed you can update by using the `leveling update` alias.

## Usage

The package comes with several aliases to operate it.

`leveling help` will bring up a help menu to explain usage while you are in Mudlet.
`leveling stop` will bring the bot to a halt in the event that you need to suddenly stop.

## Final thoughts, how to contribute, thanks, things like that

Still a work in progress, for example it needs to be able to add areas easily without editing the lua files directly. If you'd like to help by contributing to this, please do.
